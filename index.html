            <h1>Hi! I am <span style="color:darkcyan;">Kaniz Fatema</span></h1>
            <h4>I am a student of Management Studies at Jagannath University. As a management student, I am dreaming to become an IT expert(Web Design or Development Preferable). I want to become a successful freelancer. </h4>
            <p>I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to explore, I like to travel; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean. I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night. I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn. I like to be surrounded by people. I like countryâ€™s peace, I like delicious food and comfortable shoes; I like the land and the nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh.</p>
